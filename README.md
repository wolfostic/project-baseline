# Project Status

This repository contains **Project Baseline**, an ongoing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) project that applies qualitative risk analysis supplemented by quantitative Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) estimates to support decision-making and control evaluation methodologies in a scoped, real-world environment.

The project is currently a **work in progress (WIP)**. Artifacts are added incrementally as analyses are completed and reviewed.

To avoid disclosure of sensitive or exploitable information, all documentation intentionally abstracts implementation-specific details while preserving risk logic, methodology, and decision-making rationale.
