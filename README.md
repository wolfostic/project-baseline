# Project Status

This repository contains **Project Baseline**, an ongoing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) project conducted from the perspective of an IT Risk Analyst. The project applies qualitative and quantitative risk analysis to analyze risk scenarios and evaluate control effectiveness within a scoped, non-enterprise environment.

The project is currently a **work in progress (WIP)**. Artifacts are added incrementally as analysis activities are completed and refined.

To avoid disclosure of sensitive or exploitable information, all documentation intentionally abstracts implementation-specific details while preserving risk logic, methodology, and analytical rationale.

## Role Assumed in This Project

This project is executed from the perspective of an IT Risk Analyst. The work focuses on analytical and documentation responsibilities typically performed by an analyst role rather than on governance or executive decision-making functions.

Responsibilities represented include:

- Identification of risk candidates based on assets, system conditions, and environmental assumptions

- Development of clear risk statements and supporting threat scenarios

- Qualitative risk analysis, including likelihood and impact assessment

- Quantitative risk analysis, including Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) and Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

- Documentation of existing and recommended controls

- Identification and documentation of inherent and residual risk

- Maintenance of risk-related artifacts such as risk assessments and a risk register snapshot

Risk ownership, executive decision-making, and formal acceptance authority are intentionally excluded from this role.

## Scope of Artifacts Included

The repository includes analytical artifacts intended to demonstrate risk analysis capability, not organizational authority. Included artifacts may consist of:

- Risk assessment write-ups for identified risks

- A partial or snapshot view of the risk register

- Supporting documentation used to frame risk context and assumptions

These artifacts represent inputs and outputs that an IT Risk Analyst would typically use and prepare for review by risk owners, managers, or governance bodies.

## Artifacts Explicitly Out of Scope

The following items are intentionally excluded to preserve role accuracy and governance realism:

- Formal risk acceptance decisions

- Executive approval or authorization records

- Enterprise compliance claims or audit-ready documentation

- Organization-wide risk appetite or tolerance statements

Such items are typically owned by risk owners, IT risk managers, or senior leadership, and would not be authored or approved by an analyst-level role.

## Educational and Demonstrative Context

This project is designed to demonstrate structured risk thinking and familiarity with governance-aligned workflows using the NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework. While all RMF steps are represented conceptually, role responsibilities are framed to reflect realistic analyst participation rather than full organizational authority.
